  Flavour 04

  Date: Nov 2018

  Description: While I could spend hours learning how they work and writing the code for
               an Arduino to control it it's much faster to include the Arduino servo
               library instead; so now with only a few changes I can convert the 
               potentiometer position into motorized motion \o/

  Board: Arduino UNO

  Arduino IDE: 1.8.7
